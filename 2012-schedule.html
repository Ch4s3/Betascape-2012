			<h2>Lab Overview:</h2>

			<p>Digital fabrication is a process that includes the digital creation of 2D and 3D content whose manufacture is, in part or in whole, realized through the use of computer controlled machines. The process begins with computer modeling. This can be something as simple as a planar (2D) line drawing or as complicated spatial models (3D). There are various techniques and methods of creating these digital models.</p>

			<p>The next part of the digital fabrication process is to generate physical translations of the digital models. When the physical object is created (output) the digital models are sent to a computer-controlled machine as a set of instructions so that the duplication process may begin and repeated. There are many different types of technologies and methods for creating the physical objects. This lab will present an advanced and intro overview of the leading computer modeling and 3D printing technologies.

			<h2>Lab Overview</h2>

			<p>For the Betascape Physical Computing Lab we will be exploring how humans communicate through computers by considering how humans express themselves physically (through light, sound, heat and motion) and then extend it using sensors and computers. We're all accustomed to the usual suspects of human-computer interaction (keyboard, video & mouse) and so in this workshop we want to push participants to move beyond them and experiment with tangible interaction design to create novel ways for each other to interact.</p>

			<p>This lab will take a hands-on approach which means that participants will have a collaborative space to build circuits, solder, code up some programs and build structures to hold sensors and controls and figure out how to make it all relate to people. We will also be offering a variety of workshops throughout the day including 'Introduction to Arduino', 'Overview of Arduino Shields' and 'Hacking your Toaster to the Internet'.
